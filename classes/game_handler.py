    GameHandler implements the logic of a Super Tic-Tac-Toe game.

    GameHandler Attributes
        board          - global board, a SuperTicTacToeBoard instance
        active_player  - which player takes turn. one of [1 2]
        mouse_pos      - (x,y) mouse coordinates to process the player's action
        sound_on       - whether to play sounds
        screen         - pygame surface where the game is displayed

    GameHandler Methods
        process_events - process the events of the game (mouse clicks)
        run_logic      - runs the logic of the game based on user's actions
        draw           - displays the game's elements on the given surface
        run            - runs the main loop to play the game
