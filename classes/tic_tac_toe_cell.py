class TicTacToeCell:
    """
    TicTacToeCell defines a cell in a TicTacToe board.
        In the common TicTacToe board there are 9 cells. Each one can be filled
        by just one of the two players during the game. A cell can be filled
        only if it is available. Once a cell is filled by a player, the cell
        has a winner and it's no longer available and can't be filled again.
        This class is intended to be used inside the TicTacToeBoard
        class to define the cells' behaviour and the game's logic.

    TicTacToeCell Attributes:
        width     - cell's shape is a {width}x{width} square
        _winner   - {0: not filled, 1: filled by player1, 2: filled by player2}
        available - whether the cell can be filled in the current turn

    TicTacToeCell Methods:
        winner        - return value of _winner
        update        - updates the cell state: _winner, available attributes
        draw          - displays the cell depending on its _winner value
        collidepoint  - checks whether a given point collides with the cell
